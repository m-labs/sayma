\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs}

BaseMod provides two independent RF outputs, featuring:

\begin{itemize}

	\item
	\textbf{Bandwidth}: 10MHz - 4GHz (upper frequency is limited by
	several different components)
	\item
%	\textbf{Max output power}: ?dBm (limited by ?).
	\item
	\textbf{Output filters}: either 3 Mini-Circuits FV1206 series filters,
	or a user-definable discrete 9-pole discrete-element filter using 0402
	components.
	\item
	\textbf{Low phase noise amplifier}: Mini-Circuits ERA-4XSM+); 14.2dBm
	gain at 1GHz.
	\item
	\textbf{Digitally programmable attenuator}: HMC542BLP4E; 0dB to 31.dB
	in 0.5dB steps; controllable in real-time.
	\item
	\textbf{Fast, high-isolation RF switch}: HMC349LP4C; 67dB isolation at
	1GHz; controllable in with real-time control.
	\item
	\textbf{Power detector}: AD8363ACPZ on switch ``off'' port for
	monitoring and power levelling.
	\item
	\textbf{Optional isolation of output grounds}: to avoid ground loops,
	achieved by fitting capacitors and washers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs}

BaseMod provides two independent inputs, each of which can be configured
(component placement) as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
	\item
	Direct feed to ADC via ADA4927-1 buffer for maximum bandwidth
	\item
	Low-noise programmable gain instrumentation amplifier (AD8253)
	front-end
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\textbf{Bandwidth}: DC-300kHz
	\item
	\textbf{Input ranges}: ±0.1V, ±1V, ±10V
	\item
	\textbf{Fully differential inputs}: 100k between each input signal and
	ground and the circuit ground
	\item
	\textbf{Filters}: Common-mode and differential mode filtering of RF
	interference for optimum DC precision
	\item
	\textbf{Input protection}: diodes between each input and the supply
	rails for maximum ruggedness
	\item
	Supports both high-speed input directly coupled into a high-speed
	pre-amp, and low-frequency inputs using a variable-gain
	instrumentation amplifier (choice by component selection). Pull
	details from \href{https://github.com/m-labs/sinara/issues/81}{\#81}
	\item
	Instrumentation amp: gain, filters, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MixMod}\label{mixmod}

MixMod is an up-converting mezzanine, using an analogue IQ mixer to mix
the input and output RF signals with a LO supplied by Sayma.

The LO provided by Sayma should be a 3V3 PECL square-wave.

Design files are
\href{https://github.com/m-labs/sinara/tree/master/ARTIQ_ALTIUM/Sayma_AFEs/MixMod}{here}
\href{https://github.com/m-labs/sinara/tree/master/ARTIQ_ALTIUM/Sayma_AFEs/BaseMod}{here}.

\subsubsection{Outputs}\label{outputs-1}

MixMod provides a single RF output between 2.5GHz and 3.5GHz, produced
by mixing two DAC channels with a LO supplied by Sayma. Other than the
IQ mixer, the output signal-chain is identical to BaseMod.

\subsubsection{Inputs}\label{inputs-1}

MixMod's two inputs can either be operated in baseband or downconversion
mode (selectable by component choice). In baseband mode, the inputs
function identically to BaseMod's. In downconversion mode, a single SMA
input feeds the RF port on an IQ mixer to produce a pair of baseband
signals, which then feed the two signal chains.
