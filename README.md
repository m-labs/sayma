This repository is largely depreciated as we now give each piece of hardware its own repository within the [sinara-hw organization](https://github.com/sinara-hw) instead of using this one.

The main exception is issue tracking for Sayma which remains [here](https://github.com/sinara-hw/sinara/issues).

The [meta repository](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta) is where Sinara management, inter-board design, incubation of new projects, etc. now occur.  Use either the [Main Sinara Wiki](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/wiki) or [Meta Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/issues) as appropriate.
